# AI and ML Engineering For Dummies - Recruiter Guide
To strategically leverage AI in talent acquisition, a functional understanding of the underlying technology is no longer optional. For a recruiter in the tech industry, this literacy is not about learning to code but about developing the capacity to evaluate vendor claims, understand the tools' capabilities and limitations, and communicate effectively with technical candidates and stakeholders. Here we'll demystifies the core technologies driving the recruitment revolution, cutting through marketing jargon to provide a clear, functional understanding of what AI and Machine Learning are and how they operate within the talent context.

## **AI/ML Engineering**
You hear the terms Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) all the time, and they're often used interchangeably. But in reality, they aren't the same. Understanding the fundamental difference is crucial and the difference is more simple than you think.

Think of it like this:
- Artificial Intelligence is the big goal. It's the overall idea of creating machines that can "think" and "act" like humans to solve problems. This could be anything from a simple chatbot that follows a set of rules to a super-smart robot that can have a conversation and solve complex puzzles.
- Machine Learning is one of the most powerful tools in the AI toolbox. It's a specific method that lets machines learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed with every single rule.

<li> Example: ChatGPT for generating text and answering questions or DALL·E for creating images based on descriptions</li></ul>
