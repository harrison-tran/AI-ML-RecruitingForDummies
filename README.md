# AI and ML Engineering For Dummies - Recruiter Guide
Explaining common technical terminologies for Recruiters like myself to understand better. 

## **AI/ML Engineering**
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is like creating a smart assistant or robot that can do tasks that typically require human intelligence. It involves teaching machines how to think, reason, and solve problems. For example, when you ask Siri to set a timer, that’s AI. It understands your request and acts on it.

### **There are many different types of AI**
- Narrow AI - designed to perform one specific task really well. It’s like an expert at a single thing but knows nothing else. Like a calculator
- General AI - would be like a human in terms of intelligence. It can learn, reason, and solve any problem across different domains, not just one. General AI would be like a human in terms of intelligence. It can learn, reason, and solve any problem across different domains, not just one.
- Super AI - AI that’s smarter than humans at everything (which is purely hypothetical and doesn't exist)

TLDR: Right now only applications of Narrow AI exists.

### **Under Narrow AI, there are three different categorizations:**
<details>
<summary>Reactive AI - works in the moment. It looks at what’s happening right now and responds based on pre-defined rules or patterns.</summary>
<br>
<ul><li>Imagine a vending machine. You press a button, and it gives you a snack. It doesn’t remember what you bought last time or guess what you’ll want next. It just reacts to the button you press.</li>
<li>Example: Spam filters in email systems (they analyze each email and decide whether it’s spam based on rules)</li></ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Limited Memory AI - can temporarily “remember” past information to make better decisions. However, this memory isn’t permanent—it’s like writing on a whiteboard and erasing it after the task is done.</summary>
<br>
<ul><li>Think of a waiter at a restaurant. They can remember your order while you’re at the table, but once the food is served, they forget what you ordered. They can’t recall it the next day.</li>
<li> Example: Chatbots (like ChatGPT) that maintain the context of a conversation for a short time but don’t retain long-term memory.</li></ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Generative AI - designed to create or generate something new, like text, images, or music, based on patterns it has learned</summary>
<br>
<ul><li>Think of a recipe book. It can combine ingredients to create a variety of dishes, but it doesn’t “know” if the food tastes good or if you’ll like it. It’s just following learned patterns</li>
<li> Example: ChatGPT for generating text and answering questions or DALL·E for creating images based on descriptions</li></ul>
